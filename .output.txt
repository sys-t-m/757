You can also run `php --ini` in a terminal to see which files are used by PHP in CLI mode.
Alternatively, you can run Composer with `--ignore-platform-req=ext-zip` to temporarily ignore these required extensions.
You can also try re-running composer require with an explicit version constraint, e.g. "composer require doctrine/dbal:*" to figure out if any version is installable, or "composer require doctrine/dbal:^2.1" if you know which you need.
Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
